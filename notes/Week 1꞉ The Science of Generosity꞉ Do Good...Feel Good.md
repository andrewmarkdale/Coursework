# Week 1: The Science of Generosity: Do Good...Feel Good

## 1.1 - Why Explore Generosity?

Learning outcomes of the first week:
- Define Generosity
- Identify ways of giving, both traditional and nontraditional
- Describe your own values, perceptions, and meanings of generosity
- Compare and contrast your values, perceptions, and meanings of generosity with those of other communities and cultures

### Video 1 - Introduction and Goals:
- You have to do good for the sake of doing good and you will feel good

Goals:
- Explore generosity holistically
- Make generosity personal
- Gain new ideas; reflect on attitude

We will be doing simple experiential activities. 

Instructor hopes we will discuss concepts with other students. Since students are from different cultures we may be able to foster different ideas about generosity. 

What are the motivations for generosity?

See the science of generosity using the evidence from a broad range of disciplines - from economics to social sciences, neurology, neurosciences etc.

The course is meant to be personal, compare and contrast my values with the instructors and other students. 

### Video 2 - Does Generosity Improve Our Lives?:

Does consuming more goods make people happier? 

Beyond a point, essentially no. 

> #### Diminishing marginal utility (DMU) 
> First amount of any good consumed gives us a lot of happiness. The more this good is consumed the less happy it makes us. E.g. the novelty wears off.

The instructor posits a question: Will DMU apply when practicing generosity? She gives the example of giving 10 dollars to a single person in one dollar increments or 10 people one dollar each. Which would be happier? The instructor (and common sense) suggests the latter. We should be spreading our generosity across society. 

The instructor asks us how we would spend $5. Buy a coffee for both myself and a friend? Save it? Buy a book for myself? Give it to a homeless stranger?

The instructor gives an anecdote about when she smiled at a homeless stranger. This apparently meant a lot to the stranger as usually passersby barely acknowledge their existence -- despite being given money or food. The stranger acknowledges that the money and food are meaningful and they are grateful, but to be acknowledged means that much more. Not only was it meaningful to the stranger, it also improved the day of the instructor.  

#### Smiling is an act of generosity. Do good, feel good - can start with a smile.

### Reading - There's Magic in Your Smile:

Current research suggests that smiling is contagious and can make us appear more attractive to others. It lifts our mood, as well as the moods of those around us. It also suggests that it can lengthen our lives. 

According to the article, smiling activates the release of neuropeptides that fight off stress. Dopamine, serotonin and endorphins are released when we smile. This not only relaxes the body, it can lower the heart rate and blood pressure. Similarly, endorphins act as a pain reliever.

You're better looking when you smile. When smiling, you're perceived as more attractive, reliable, relaxed, and sincere. Seeing someone smiles activate the reward centre of the brain - you feel rewarded when you see someone smile. In one study, it was found that both men and women were more attracted to images of people smiling and making eye contact than those not.  

#### When you smile, you're coaxing others to return the favour.

#### Empathy quiz score - 77
